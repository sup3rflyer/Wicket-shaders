// Debandit v3.4 — Detect-and-Reconstruct Deband, plane-fit estimator
// Copyright (C) 2026 Agust Ari · GPL-3.0
//
// Second-generation Debandit. The detect-and-reconstruct philosophy, the
// two-regime apply (snap vs LF-only), the four soft gates, the chroma
// opponent path and the trust-mask machinery carry over from v1.11
// UNCHANGED — what changes is the RAMP ESTIMATOR and the contamination
// story around it:
//
// 1. WEIGHTED PLANE FIT replaces the premultiplied Gaussian chains. Per
//    1/4-res texel, the pre-quantization ramp is estimated as the weighted
//    least-squares plane over a box window (radius db_rw texels), weights =
//    trust mask x chroma fit-mask. A plane fit has no curvature bias to
//    first order, so the 2S - S2 deconvolution (and its four kernel-table
//    copies) retires; genuinely smooth shading is a structural no-op by
//    construction, and the fit tracks CURVED shading (faces, glows) that
//    the sigma-48 refit misread by ~1.7 codes — the v1.x luma-on-shaded-
//    surfaces class. One-sided windows at frame borders fit a plane
//    through in-frame texels only: the v1.x border DC tilt (~0.19 codes)
//    measures ~0.01 codes here.
// 2. FIT RESIDUAL as pointwise contamination signal. The fit hands us,
//    almost free (three quadratic moments), the RMS of M minus the fitted
//    plane over the window — per axis (luma / opponent). A banding
//    staircase leaves ~0.3-0.6 codes of sawtooth residual; a bulk-contrast
//    edge inside the window leaves tens. The apply gates each scale's
//    validity on its residual with NO dilation (the residual already
//    integrates exactly the window the fit used), which shrinks the
//    bulk-edge collar to roughly the window radius. The +-8-texel
//    contamination envelope stays as remote-bias insurance (seeds and
//    knees unchanged from v1.11).
// 3. VALIDITY-NORMALIZED SCALE BLEND. Wide (db_rw) and short (db_rs)
//    fits blend by relative validity: c_eff = (wL*cL + wS*cS)/(wL+wS),
//    wS = (1-vL)*vS*db_ms. Unlike the v1.10 linear mix, a fully-condemned
//    scale contributes NOTHING — a plane fit near a bulk edge can carry
//    |c| ~ 10 codes where the Gaussian bias was ~2, so any leftover
//    fraction of an invalid field is visible (measured: 1.1-code paint
//    inside colored squares with the linear mix, 0.06 with this blend).
//    The gate is the validity of what was actually blended:
//    w_env = (wL*vL + wS*vS)/(wL+wS).
// 4. FRAME NOISE FLOOR (SSBO) + ANISOTROPY DISCRIMINATOR. A COMPUTE
//    reduce estimates the frame's true dither/grain floor as the p10 of
//    raw block MADs (histogram walk, 2-3 frame EMA). It de-circularizes
//    the structure-tensor texture flag that v1.11 built and reverted:
//    significant ISOTROPIC gradient energy (2-D mottle, measured against
//    the FLOOR, not against local MAD which texture inflates) closes the
//    snap regime — the LF correction stays, grain-region semantics.
//    Banding contours are locally 1-D (coherence ~1) and never flag;
//    dither is isotropic but sits at ~0.3x floor, under the significance
//    knee. Measured on a 10-bit BD stress set: fine-texture
//    retention inside former snap zones +10 to +34 points, dithered-8-bit
//    suite bit-flat (the failure that killed the v1.11 experiment).
//
// v2.1 = v2.0 with PASS FUSION, no math change (outputs identical): 20
// passes -> 16. The three Wide Moments row passes fuse into one COMPUTE
// pass (one window walk instead of three identical ones), and the three
// H-stage gathers (flatness range / chroma range / tensor rows) fuse the
// same way. Multi-output passes write their extra fields to fixed-size
// storage textures (the film-grain template mechanism); their consumers
// run as COMPUTE and imageLoad them. Every texture the full-res Apply
// samples stays an ordinary hook texture, so its bilinear reads are
// untouched. Envelope: the fixed 1024x576 allocations cover sources up
// to 4096x2304; wider is outside this shader's design envelope (storage
// writes are bounds-checked and loads clamp both axes — degraded, not
// undefined).
//
// v2.2 = v2.1 + GRID DEBLOCK EVIDENCE (db_block). Six-source
// characterization (dev deblock/): DCT grid blocking is an AVC-web-dl
// artifact — boundaries structurally fixed at x,y = 16k source px, so the
// phase is HARD-CODED, no search. Blocking spoofs three protection layers
// at once (it is noise statistically shaped like texture): the aniso flag,
// the structure gate, and the block-MAD snap knees — and its steps can
// exceed the default snap authority. The fix stays estimator-shaped:
// measure grid-locked EXCESS (mean boundary-phase |grad| minus interior,
// windowed +-34px, per axis) and a CONTRAST classifier (boundary/interior,
// knee 2.2-3.0 — BD content's own faint MB grid reads <= ~2 on flats and
// must not fire); then every opened gate's knee shifts by a bounded
// multiple of the excess (CLAMPED to db_thr — beyond that is phase-
// aligned real structure, not blocking), and the snap authority extends
// by ~the measured step (same cap). DENSE real texture raises the
// interior term equally and self-normalizes the contrast to ~1; the
// residual spoof class is faint 16px-pitch phase-locked DELIBERATE
// patterns (pixel art, exact-16 tone work) — indistinguishable locally,
// db_block=0 is the escape. Known limits, honest: isolated DC stamps
// mostly sit UNDER the classifier (the +-34px window mean dilutes a
// single boundary column ~17x; they fire only on quiet low-floor darks
// — misses are the safe direction); texture CO-LOCATED with strong
// blocking loses aniso snap protection region-wide, softening bounded
// by the snap authority (~db_thr-scale codes); the structure-gate shift
// also reaches the chroma weight through the pre-existing shared w_tex
// factor (small, blocking is chroma-banded too — accepted); evidence is
// per-frame, GOP-cadence stability unverified (EMA = the v2.3 candidate
// if stamps/marginal mosaics pulse); top-cropped streams shift the y
// phase (x evidence still fires). Mosquito/ringing is a separate
// edge-locked mechanism, deliberately NOT this knob.
//
// v3.0 = v2.2 + BOUNDED-SMOOTHNESS RECONSTRUCTOR (db_curve). The sizing
// prototype (dev debandit-v3) falsified the "estimator needs curvature"
// charter: on curved-field banding (vignette rings, glow domes, dark
// gradient walls) EVERY least-squares upgrade — quadratic basis, wider
// windows, oriented 1-D fit, iterated refit — saturates at ~half the
// staircase energy, because a more flexible fit partially FOLLOWS the
// quantization staircase it should cross (the quadratic explains 30%
// more window variance yet corrects LESS). What reaches the measured
// ceiling is a masked lowpass under the existing bounds: on a CONFIRMED
// quantized surface the step size itself is the evidence bound, so
// smoothing inside the amplitude gate is evidence-bounded by
// construction — the estimator's job collapses to CONFIRMATION, and the
// reconstruction is the smoothness prior. Machinery: sigma-3 (1/4-res)
// fitmask-NORMALIZED separable lowpass of M (two 17-tap passes,
// mean-subtracted rows re-referenced in fp32 — the wide-moments
// pattern; x8 encode headroom, see the LP V note); in the apply the
// correction SOURCE blends fit -> lowpass per axis by db_curve x the
// ENVELOPE gate x the LP's own confidence (trusted mass x support
// symmetry, carried in DB2_LPC alpha). The fit-residual term is
// deliberately NOT in the blend weight — on curved shading the plane's
// residual carries the very curvature+staircase the reconstructor
// exists for, and a residual-shaped share measures NO better than the
// fit alone (11% vs 38% ripple recovery on the 1312 rings). Bulk-edge
// safety comes from the envelope (its +-8 seed reach equals the LP
// window), the symmetry fade (a normalized convolution is biased on a
// ramp under one-sided support — frame borders, mask collars; the fade
// keeps the FIT there, which is exact), and the downstream gates + snap
// machinery, which all read the BLENDED correction — the reconstructor
// rides the entire v2 tower. Fallback: db_curve = 0 (DYNAMIC) is
// 1-ULP-equivalent to v2.2 (<= 1 px/frame — every algebraic blend form
// perturbs Metal's luma-chain scheduling that much; fine for live A/B);
// the BIT-exact escape is the deep define DB2_CURVE_PATH 0 in the Apply
// pass (compiles the blend out; proven byte-identical on the suite).
// Honest limits: a smoothness prior is NOT intrinsically conservative
// (a plane fit is) — measured naked it costs fine texture where the
// tower is what saves it, so db_curve must never be applied outside
// the gates; masked (hair-class) regions hand back to the fit via the
// alpha weight; sigma 3 under-reaches band pitches past ~12 texels
// (~45% residual at 15-texel rings — a safe miss; pitch tracking is
// the follow-up if coarse rings matter in the field); smooth REAL
// low-amplitude modulation (soft lighting, gentle undulation) loses
// the fit-residual protection on the LP path — pulled toward the
// local mean, always bounded by the amplitude gate (~<= db_thr, worst
// class ~1 code on soft-glow S-edges) — lower db_curve on clean
// high-bit sources; the positive banding-evidence blend term is the
// principled follow-up.
//
// v3.1 = v3.0 + FLOOR-ADAPTIVE SNAP KNEES (db_fsnap). The static snap
// MAD knees (1.3-2.1 / darks 0.6-1.6) were tuned on quiet encodes
// (flat-field dither ~0.2-0.3 codes); a BD remux carries ~0.7-0.9 and
// its dilated MAD sits past the knees, so the snap regime closes and
// dither rides through frame-wide (the "grain band on flat areas"
// field report). The p10 frame floor is the WRONG predictor — frames
// mixing pristine black with dithered skies read a quiet p10 while the
// sky needs the shift (measured: remux t=1176 floor 0.05, sky needs
// +1.2 codes). The Noise Floor pass therefore also measures the FLAT-
// FIELD dither level: the p50 of raw block MADs restricted to row-flat
// (range < 2 codes over the trust-masked +-8 gather) DITHERED blocks
// (MAD in 0.05..6 codes — the caps exclude untrusted-center collapse
// above and pristine solid fills below; pristine blocks are counted
// separately and, when they dominate the flats, converge dfl to the
// histogram floor instead of voting the p50 into bin 0 — see the
// three-way branch in the Noise Floor pass). Same log-hist / EMA /
// relock machinery, second SSBO scalar (db2_dfl, also FLOORTEX .y).
// The apply shifts BOTH luma snap knees (bright + dark mix) by
// db_fsnap x min(3.5 x max(dfl - 0.35, 0), 1.8) codes — hinge and cap
// calibrated on the 16-case catalogue + audit-round synthetics (dev
// debandit-v31-floorsnap): every remux stress frame lands inside the
// shifted knees (needs 1.2-1.6), a minority dithered sky next to a
// pristine-black majority still fires (the audit-F1 class), the Judas
// encode / quiet 10-bit scenes sit BELOW the hinge (dfl 0.27-0.30 vs
// 0.35, two histogram bins of margin -> shift exactly 0.0, static
// knees, byte-stable), and the cap refuses film-grain-class floors so
// heavy live-action grain is absorbed at most ~cap past the static
// knees (real420 face: dfl 0.91, capped — watch the retention tower).
// Chroma knees stay static this round (a chroma analog only if the
// field shows a chroma grain band); note dfl itself keys on the
// max-channel block MAD, so heavy chroma-only dither can raise it —
// accepted, luma/chroma dither correlate in practice. dfl is one
// frame-global scalar: a frame whose flats are dominated by a bright
// dithered sky also shifts the DARK knees (0.6-1.6 base) by the same
// amount — bounded by the cap, the flat-cert gates and the aniso
// flag; per-zone dfl is the escalation if the field ever shows dark
// shadow-detail loss. Knee-shift form: the shift is EXACTLY +0.0 when
// db_fsnap = 0 or the source is below the hinge, and x + 0.0 is
// IEEE-exact under any FMA/reassociation — so db_fsnap = 0 is a
// BIT-exact escape (framemd5-proven; no compile-out define needed,
// unlike the db_curve source-blend class).
//
// v3.4 = v3.1 + PASS FUSION round 2, no math change (output values
// identical): 19 passes -> 16, plus the frame-reduce parallelism fix.
// (v3.2/v3.3 were internal development explorations that did not ship.)
// The v2.1 fusion mechanism extends to three more sibling pairs whose
// walks are unrelated but share a dispatch: Median V absorbs the Fit
// Mask (chroma-agreement weights computed from the fp16-quantized median
// exactly as the separate pass read them back — FITMASK becomes r16f
// storage, its consumers imageLoad it), Flatness Range V absorbs Grid
// Env H (GRIDH -> storage), and Chroma Range V absorbs Contamination
// Env H (ENV_H -> storage; Env V converts to COMPUTE and imageLoads
// it). Short Fuse and Env V convert fragment -> COMPUTE (the v2.1
// rerun measured such conversions faster, not slower). The Noise Floor
// reduce — measured 23-31% of the whole shader on a desktop D3D11
// target because a single 144-lane workgroup serializes it — widens to
// a 1024-lane workgroup: bin counts are integer atomics, so any lane
// count produces the identical histogram, percentile, EMA and SSBO
// state, bitwise. The fusions retire two cross-pass constant-sync
// hazards (the Median/Fit mask knee pair and nothing else changed
// hands). Envelope note: FITMASK/GRIDH/ENV_H storage shares the fixed
// 1024x576 allocation rule (sources past 4096x2304 degrade, not break)
// — this newly covers the short fit's mask reads, which previously had
// no storage dependence; in-envelope behavior is unchanged.
//
// Chain order: list BEFORE CelFlare in glsl-shaders (same-hook passes run
// in load order; CelFlare's expansion multiplies any step not flattened
// first). The previous v1.11 generation is archived outside the public
// release repo; its db_* PARAM names remain compatible for historical A/B.
//
// Known limits, documented honestly:
// - Hair-class dense structure (strand clusters every ~15px) still
//   passes through: both windows are mostly masked there, conf fades the
//   fit out. Passthrough beats fabrication; unchanged from v1.x.
// - The collar around bulk-contrast edges shrinks to ~window radius
//   (short scale: ~15-20px) but does not vanish; a fit whose window
//   straddles a 50-code edge is unusable no matter the estimator. The
//   honest full fix remains similarity-aware weights (a v2.1 candidate:
//   tonal kernel, non-separable).
// - Mid-scale (8-40px) mottle BELOW the noise-significance knee is still
//   absorbed in snap zones; the floor turns this from "30-50% of texture
//   energy" into a bounded tail.
// - The frame floor is a per-frame scalar: content mixing a pristine
//   quiet region with a heavily dithered one reads a low floor and the
//   anisotropy flag gets conservative (more texture protected, slightly
//   less dither absorbed) — the safe direction.
// - EMA state: db2_floor lives in an SSBO and survives shader reload
//   (2-3 frame convergence makes this harmless).
// - mod-4 dimension tap-phase caveat unchanged from v1.x.

// the raw-coordinate formulation loses ~0.25 code to ulp). The fuse pass
// re-references rows to its own center in fp32 registers.
// Channel layout across the three textures (12 scalars):
//   A: (sum w, sum w*u, sum w*u^2, sum w*dY^2)
//   B: (sum w*dM.rgb, sum w*do1^2)
//   C: (sum w*u*dM.rgb, sum w*do2^2)
// dY/do1/do2 are the luma/opponent projections of dM = M(tap) - M(center):
// the quadratic moments feed the FIT RESIDUAL per gate axis.
// v2.1: ONE compute pass fills all three (was three passes making the
// identical window walk). A rides out_image (an ordinary hook texture —
// the fuse passes sample it); B/C go to storage. Per-accumulator sum
// order is unchanged, so the stored moments are bit-identical to v2.0.

// every LS basis partially FOLLOWS the staircase on curved shading; the
// normalized lowpass crosses it at the measured ceiling).
// Precision: rows accumulate MEAN-SUBTRACTED against the output texel's
// own median (the wide-moments fp16-ulp insurance — raw M sums at fp16
// cost ~0.5 code); the V stage re-references each row in fp32. Off-frame
// taps at zero weight (v1.7 border rule). The H output (signed row sums,

// already requires (v2.1 storage textures); the 0.5-offset unorm
// insurance is deliberately NOT used here, its ulp-at-0.5 costs more
// than it protects. The signed FIRST MOMENT of the weights (sum w*i,
// texel units) side-outputs to DB2_LP_MX storage: the V stage folds it
// into a support-SYMMETRY fade — a normalized convolution is exact on a
// ramp only under symmetric trusted support; one-sided support (frame
